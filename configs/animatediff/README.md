> **Task**: Text2Video

<!-- [ALGORITHM] -->

## Abstract

<!-- [ABSTRACT] -->

With the advance of text-to-image models (e.g., Stable Diffusion) and corresponding personalization techniques such as DreamBooth and LoRA, everyone can manifest their imagination into high-quality images at an affordable cost. Subsequently, there is a great demand for image animation techniques to further combine generated static images with motion dynamics. In this report, we propose a practical framework to animate most of the existing personalized text-to-image models once and for all, saving efforts in model-specific tuning. At the core of the proposed framework is to insert a newly initialized motion modeling module into the frozen text-to-image model and train it on video clips to distill reasonable motion priors. Once trained, by simply injecting this motion modeling module, all personalized versions derived from the same base T2I readily become text-driven models that produce diverse and personalized animated images. We conduct our evaluation on several public representative personalized text-to-image models across anime pictures and realistic photographs, and demonstrate that our proposed framework helps these models generate temporally smooth animation clips while preserving the domain and diversity of their outputs.

## Pretrained models

We use Stable Diffusion's weights provided by HuggingFace Diffusers. You do not have to download the weights manually. If you use Diffusers wrapper, the weights will be downloaded automatically.

This model has several weights including vae, unet and clip. You should download the weights from [stable-diffusion-1.5](https://huggingface.co/runwayml/stable-diffusion-v1-5) and change the 'pretrained_model_path' in config to the weights dir.

## Quick Start

Running the following codes, you can get a text-generated image.

### Reccomendation

It's highly recommended to install [xformers](https://github.com/facebookresearch/xformers). It would save about 20G memory for 512\*512 resolution generation.

### Steps

1. Download [ToonYou](https://civitai.com/api/download/models/78775) and MotionModule checkpoint

```bash
#!/bin/bash

mkdir models && cd models
mkdir Motion_Module && mkdir DreamBooth_LoRA
gdown 1RqkQuGPaCO5sGZ6V6KZ-jUWmsRu48Kdq -O Motion_Module/
gdown 1ql0g_Ys4UCz2RnokYlBjyOYPbttbIpbu -O models/Motion_Module/
wget https://civitai.com/api/download/models/78775 -P DreamBooth_LoRA/ --content-disposition --no-check-certificate
```

2. Modify the config file in `configs/animatediff/animatediff_ToonYou.py`

```python
    models_path = {Your Checkpoints Path}
    motion_module_cfg=dict(
        path={Your MotionModule Path}
    ),
    dream_booth_lora_cfg=dict(
        type='ToonYou',
        path={Your Dreambooth_Lora Path},
        steps=25,
        guidance_scale=7.5)
```
