## Introduction

MMEditing is an open source image and video editing toolbox based on PyTorch. It is a part of the [OpenMMLab](https://open-mmlab.github.io/) project.

The master branch works with **PyTorch 1.3 to 1.5**.

Documentation: https://mmediting.readthedocs.io/en/latest/.

### Major features

- **Modular design**

  We decompose the editing framework into different components and one can easily construct a customized editor framework by combining different modules.

- **Support of multiple tasks in editing**

  The toolbox directly supports popular and contemporary *inpainting*, *matting*, *super-resolution* ang *generation* tasks.

- **State of the art**

  The toolbox provides state-of-the-art methods in inpainting/matting/super-resolution/generation.

## Changelog

v0.5 was released in 09/07/2020.

Note that **MMSR** has been merged into this repo, as a part of MMEditing.
With elaborate designs of the new framework and careful implementations,
hope MMEditing could provide better experience.
