## Introduction

English | [ÁÆÄ‰Ωì‰∏≠Êñá](/README_zh-CN.md)

MMEditing is an open-source image and video editing toolbox based on PyTorch. It is a part of the [OpenMMLab](https://openmmlab.com/) project.

Currently, MMEditing support the following tasks:

</div>

The master branch works with **PyTorch 1.5+**.

Some Demos:

### Major features

- **Modular design**

  We decompose the editing framework into different components and one can easily construct a customized editor framework by combining different modules.

- **Support of multiple tasks in editing**

  The toolbox directly supports popular and contemporary *inpainting*, *matting*, *super-resolution* and *generation* tasks.

- **State of the art**

  The toolbox provides state-of-the-art methods in inpainting/matting/super-resolution/generation.

Note that **MMSR** has been merged into this repo, as a part of MMEditing.
With elaborate designs of the new framework and careful implementations,
hope MMEditing could provide better experience.

## News

- [2022-04-01] v0.14.0 was released.
  - Support TOFlow in video frame interpolation
- [2022-03-01] v0.13.0 was released.
  - Support CAIN
  - Support EDVR-L
  - Support running in Windows
- [2022-02-11] Switch to **PyTorch 1.5+**. The compatibility to earlier versions of PyTorch will no longer be guaranteed.

Please refer to [changelog.md](docs/en/changelog.md) for details and release history.

## Installation

MMEditing depends on [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/) and [MMCV](https://github.com/open-mmlab/mmcv).
Below are quick steps for installation.

**Step 1.**
Install PyTorch following [official instructions](https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/).

**Step 2.**
Install MMCV with [MIM](https://github.com/open-mmlab/mim).

```
pip3 install openmim
mim install mmcv-full
```

**Step 3.**
Install MMEditing from source.

```
git clone https://github.com/open-mmlab/mmediting.git
cd mmediting
pip3 install -e .
```

Please refer to [install.md](../../wiki/1.-Installation) for more detailed instruction.

## Getting Started

Please see [getting_started.md](docs/en/getting_started.md) and [demo.md](docs/en/demo.md) for the basic usage of MMEditing.
