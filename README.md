## Introduction

MMEditing is an open-source image and video editing toolbox based on PyTorch. It is a part of the [OpenMMLab](https://openmmlab.com/) project.

Currently, MMEditing supports the following tasks:

</div>

The master branch works with **PyTorch 1.5+**.

<summary>Major features</summary>

- **Modular design**

  We decompose the editing framework into different components and one can easily construct a customized editor framework by combining different modules.

- **Support of multiple tasks in editing**

  The toolbox directly supports popular and contemporary *inpainting*, *matting*, *super-resolution* and *generation* tasks.

- **State of the art**

  The toolbox provides state-of-the-art methods in inpainting/matting/super-resolution/generation.

Note that **MMSR** has been merged into this repo, as a part of MMEditing.
With elaborate designs of the new framework and careful implementations,
hope MMEditing could provide better experience.

## What's New

### üíé Stable version

**0.16.0** was released in 31/10/2022:

- `VisualizationHook` is deprecated. Users should use `MMEditVisualizationHook` instead.
- Fix FLAVR register.
- Fix the number of channels in RDB.

Please refer to [changelog.md](docs/en/changelog.md) for details and release history.

### üåü Preview of 1.x version

A brand new version of [**MMEditing v1.0.0rc1**](https://github.com/open-mmlab/mmediting/releases/tag/v1.0.0rc1) was released in 24/09/2022:

- Support all the tasks, models, metrics, and losses in [MMGeneration](https://github.com/open-mmlab/mmgeneration) üòç„ÄÇ
- Unifies interfaces of all components based on [MMEngine](https://github.com/open-mmlab/mmengine).
- Refactored and more flexible [architecture](https://mmediting.readthedocs.io/en/1.x/1_overview.html).

## Installation

MMEditing depends on [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/) and [MMCV](https://github.com/open-mmlab/mmcv).
Below are quick steps for installation.

**Step 1.**
Install PyTorch following [official instructions](https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/).

**Step 2.**
Install MMCV with [MIM](https://github.com/open-mmlab/mim).

```shell
pip3 install openmim
mim install mmcv-full
```

**Step 3.**
Install MMEditing from source.

```shell
git clone https://github.com/open-mmlab/mmediting.git
cd mmediting
pip3 install -e .
```

Please refer to [install.md](docs/en/install.md) for more detailed instruction.

## Getting Started

Please see [getting_started.md](docs/en/getting_started.md) and [demo.md](docs/en/demo.md) for the basic usage of MMEditing.
