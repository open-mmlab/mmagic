# Generation Datasets

It is recommended to symlink the dataset root to `$MMEDITING/data`. If your folder structure is different, you may need to change the corresponding paths in config files.

MMEditing supported generation datasets:

- [Paired Dataset for Pix2pix](paired-pix2pix/README.md) \[ [Homepage](http://efrosgans.eecs.berkeley.edu/pix2pix/datasets/) \]
- [Unpaired Dataset for CycleGAN](unpaired-cyclegan/README.md) \[ [Homepage](https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~taesung_park/CycleGAN/datasets/) \]
