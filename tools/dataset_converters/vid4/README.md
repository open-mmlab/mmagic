The Vid4 dataset can be downloaded from [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ZuvNNLgR85TV_whJoHM7uVb-XW1y70DW/view?usp=sharing). There are two degradations in the dataset.

1. BIx4 contains images downsampled by bicubic interpolation
2. BDx4 contains images blurred by Gaussian kernel with Ïƒ=1.6, followed by a subsampling every four pixels.
