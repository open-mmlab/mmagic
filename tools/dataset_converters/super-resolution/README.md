# Super-Resolution Datasets

It is recommended to symlink the dataset root to `$MMEDITING/data`. If your folder structure is different, you may need to change the corresponding paths in config files.

MMEditing supported super-resolution datasets:

- Image Super-Resolution
  - [DIV2K](div2k/README.md) \[ [Homepage](https://data.vision.ee.ethz.ch/cvl/DIV2K/) \]
- Video Super-Resolution
  - [REDS](reds/README.md) \[ [Homepage](https://seungjunnah.github.io/Datasets/reds.html) \]
  - [Vimeo90K](vimeo90k/README.md) \[ [Homepage](http://toflow.csail.mit.edu) \]
