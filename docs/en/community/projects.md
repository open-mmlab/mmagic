# Projects based on MMEditing

There are many awesome projects built upon MMEditing.
We list some of them as examples of how to extend MMEditing for your own projects.
As the page might not be completed, please feel free to create a PR to update this page.

We also welcome any pull request to contribute your projects in the [projects of MMEditing](https://github.com/open-mmlab/mmediting/tree/dev-1.x/projects).

## Projects as an extension

Some projects extend the boundary of MMEditing for deployment or other research fields.
They reveal the potential of what MMEditing can do. We list several of them as below.

- [PowerVQE](https://github.com/ryanxingql/powervqe): Open framework for quality enhancement of compressed videos based on PyTorch and MMEditing.
- [VR-Baseline](https://github.com/linjing7/VR-Baseline): Video Restoration Toolbox.
- [Manga-Colorization-with-CycleGAN](https://github.com/chandlerbing65nm/Manga-Colorization-with-CycleGAN): Colorizing Black&White Japanese Manga using Generative Adversarial Network.

## Projects of papers

There are also projects released with papers.
Some of the papers are published in top-tier conferences (CVPR, ICCV, and ECCV), the others are also highly influential.
To make this list also a reference for the community to develop and compare new object detection algorithms, we list them following the time order of top-tier conferences.
Methods already supported and maintained by MMDetection are not listed.
