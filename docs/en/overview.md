# Overview

MMEditing is an open-source toolbox for professional AI researchers and machine learning engineers to explore image/video processing, editing and synthesis.

MMEditing allows researchers and engineers to use pre-trained state-of-the-art models, train and develop new models easily.
MMEditing supports various tasks, including:

- Image super-resolution
- Video super-resolution
- Video frame interpolation
- Image inpainting
- Image matting
- and many other tasks coming soon!

### Why should I use transformers?

- **State of the art**

  The toolbox provides state-of-the-art methods in inpainting/matting/super-resolution/generation.

- **Easy-Modular design**

  We decompose the editing framework into different components and one can easily construct a customized editor framework by combining different modules.

- **Support of multiple tasks in editing**

  The toolbox directly supports popular and contemporary *inpainting*, *matting*, *super-resolution* and *generation* tasks.

Note that **MMSR** has been merged into this repo, as a part of MMEditing.
With elaborate designs of the new framework and careful implementations.
