MMEditing is an open-source toolbox for image and video processing, editing and synthesis.

MMEditing supports various foundamental generative models, including:

* Unconditional Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs)
* Conditional Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs)
* Internal Learning
* Diffusion Models
* And many other generative models are coming soon!


MMEditing supports various applications, including:

* Image super-resolution
* Video super-resolution
* Video frame interpolation
* Image inpainting
* Image matting
* Image-to-image translation
* And many other applications are coming soon!

MMEditing is based on `PyTorch <https://pytorch.org>`_ and is a part of the `OpenMMLab project <https://openmmlab.com/>`_.
Codes are available on `GitHub <https://github.com/open-mmlab/mmediting>`_.
