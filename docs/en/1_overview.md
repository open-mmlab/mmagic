## What is MMEditing?

MMEditing is an open-source toolbox for professional AI researchers and machine learning engineers to explore image and video processing, editing and synthesis.

MMEditing allows researchers and engineers to use pre-trained state-of-the-art models, train and develop new customized models easily.

MMEditing supports various foundamental generative models, including:

- Unconditional Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs)
- Conditional Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs)
- Internal Learning
- Diffusion Models
- And many other generative models are coming soon!

MMEditing supports various applications, including:

- Image super-resolution
- Video super-resolution
- Video frame interpolation
- Image inpainting
- Image matting
- Image-to-image translation
- And many other applications are coming soon!

## Why should I use MMEditing?

- **State of the Art**

  MMEditing provides state-of-the-art generative models to process, edit and synthesize images and videos.

- **Powerful and Popular Applications**

  MMEditing supports popular and contemporary *inpainting*, *matting*, *super-resolution* and *generation* applications. Specifically, MMEditing supports GAN interpolation, GAN projection, GAN manipulations and many other popular GAN's applications. It's time to play with your GANs! 

- **New Modular Design for Flexible Combination:**

  We decompose the editing framework into different modules and one can easily construct a customized editor framework by combining different modules. Specifically, a new design for complex loss modules is proposed for customizing the links between modules, which can achieve flexible combination among different modules.(Tutorial for [losses](advanced_guides/4_losses.md))

- **Efficient Distributed Training:**

  With support of [MMSeparateDistributedDataParallel](https://github.com/open-mmlab/mmengine/blob/main/mmengine/model/wrappers/seperate_distributed.py), distributed training for dynamic architectures can be easily implemented.
