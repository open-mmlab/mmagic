# Welcome to Projects of MMEditing

In this folder, we welcome all contribution of image, video, 3D content generation, editing and processing.

Here, these requirements, e.g. code standards, are not that strict as in core package.
Thus, developers from the community can implement their algorithms much more easily and efficiently in MMEditing.
We appreciate all contributions from community to make MMEditing greater.

Here is an [example project](./example_project) about how to add your algorithms easily.
You can copy and create your own project from the [example project](./example_project).

We also provide some documentation listed below:

- [New Model Guide](https://mmediting.readthedocs.io/en/dev-1.x/howto/models.html)

  The documentation of adding new models.

- [Contribution Guide](https://mmediting.readthedocs.io/en/dev-1.x/community/contributing.html)

  The guides for new contributors about how to add your projects to MMEditing.
